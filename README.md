# discrete_prob

program implemented with sklearn
main.py 

program implemented from scratch the above library
client.py

Note:
It is not dynamic enough to take the input and compute. Need to edit the file to change the input.
Only thing that is dynamic is giving the letter from arguments:
python3 main.py a 
or
python3 client.py a
